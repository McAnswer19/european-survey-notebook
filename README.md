# European-Survey-Notebook

A sample notebook showing some basic data science work on a kaggle dataset of different European countries. This was meant as a basic demonstration of what a basic data science workflow might look like in practice. Sadly, github's size limit on files means that I cannout upload the full original datasets, but I have provided a link to the original Kaggle dataset inside of "Euro Project.ipynb" for those that are curious.
